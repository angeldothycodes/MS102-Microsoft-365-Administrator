# Zero Trust Security Model – Core Concept

Traditionally, organizations believed in a **“trust but verify later”** approach. The idea was simple:

- If someone is inside the company network, they are assumed to be safe.
- Security measures such as:
  - **Firewalls**: Software or hardware that blocks unauthorized access.
  - **Antivirus programs**: Software to detect malware.
  - **Access controls**: Rules that decide who can do what.
- Employees and devices are assumed trustworthy.

---

## Problem with this traditional approach:
- Devices and users inside a network are not always safe. Hackers or malware can exploit weaknesses.
- Employees or contractors can accidentally click malicious links, open unsafe files, or fall for phishing attacks.
- One infected device can compromise the entire network.

---

# Zero Trust Approach

Zero Trust assumes everything is potentially unsafe, even internal resources.  
Think of it as: **“Never trust, always verify.”**

---

## Key Principles of Zero Trust:

### 1. Verify explicitly
- Authenticate users and devices every time they access a resource.
- **Example:** Just because a user is on the company network, do not assume they are allowed to access a sensitive file.

### 2. Use least-privileged access
- Give users only the access they need to perform their job.
- **Example:** A marketing employee does not need access to the financial database.

### 3. Assume breach
- Plan for the possibility that an attacker is already in the system.
- Segment networks to limit the spread of a potential attack.

---

# Five Steps to Secure Identity Infrastructure

Identity is central to Zero Trust. Here’s what organizations should do:

## 1. Strengthen credentials
- Use strong passwords and multifactor authentication (MFA).
- MFA means a user must provide two or more proofs of identity, e.g., a password plus a code sent to a phone.

## 2. Reduce attack surface
- Stop using outdated, insecure protocols.
- Limit entry points and control administrative access tightly.

## 3. Automate threat response
- Automate detection and responses so attacks are stopped quickly.

## 4. Increase awareness
- Use auditing and logging to monitor suspicious activity.
- Detect patterns that could indicate internal or external attacks.

#### 5. Enable user self-help
- Make it easy for employees to recover accounts or reset passwords without compromising security.



# 1. Identity – The Starting Point of Zero Trust

## Why Identity Comes First

### In the past:
- Security focused on networks (office buildings, firewalls).
- If you were “inside,” you were trusted.

### Today:
- Employees work remotely.
- Devices are personal (Bring Your Own Device).
- Applications are in the cloud.

👉 **There is no longer a clear network boundary.**

Because of this, **identity becomes the new security perimeter**.

---

### Identity means:
- Who the user is
- How they prove who they are
- What they are allowed to access

---

## What Microsoft Recommends

Microsoft says:
> Start with a strong cloud identity foundation.

This means:
- Strong sign-in methods
- Protected user credentials
- Protected devices

The main tool Microsoft provides for this is:
**Microsoft Entra ID**

---

### What is Microsoft Entra ID?
Microsoft Entra ID is Microsoft’s cloud-based identity and access management service.

In simple terms:
- It stores user accounts.
- It verifies sign-ins.
- It controls access to applications and data.


  
# Passwordless Authentication

Passwords are one of the weakest security mechanisms.

## Why?
- People reuse passwords.
- People choose weak passwords.
- Passwords get stolen through phishing.

**Passwordless authentication removes passwords entirely.**

Instead of typing a password, users sign in using:

---

### Windows Hello for Business
- Uses biometrics such as fingerprint or facial recognition.
- The credential stays on the device.

### Microsoft Authenticator app
- A mobile application that approves sign-ins.
- The user confirms: *“Yes, this is me.”*

### FIDO2 security keys
- Physical keys (like USB or NFC devices).
- You must physically possess the key to sign in.

### Temporary Access Pass
- A time-limited code.
- Used to set up or recover passwordless sign-in.
- Prevents permanent passwords from being required.

---

- People reuse passwords.
- People choose weak passwords.
- Passwords get stolen through phishing.

**Passwordless authentication removes passwords entirely.**

### Temporary Access Pass
- A time-limited code.
- Used to set up or recover passwordless sign-in.
- Prevents permanent passwords from being required.

👉 **This directly supports Zero Trust because identity proof is stronger and harder to steal.**

---

# Microsoft Entra Conditional Access

This is extremely important.

**Conditional Access is the policy engine behind Zero Trust.**

A policy engine means:
- A system that evaluates conditions
- Then decides whether access is allowed, blocked, or restricted

Conditional Access uses **context** to decide.

Context includes:
- Who the user is
- What they are trying to do
- Which application they are using
- How sensitive the data is

**Example:**
- A user can read a document.
- But downloading it requires extra verification.

👉 **This allows granular control, not all-or-nothing access.**

---

# Microsoft Entra Verifiable Credentials

This feature allows organizations to verify claims without storing personal data.

**Example claims:**
- Educational credentials
- Professional certifications

Instead of storing sensitive documents:
- The system verifies the credential is valid.
- The organization does not store the actual data.

This improves:
- Security
- Privacy
- Trust

---

# 2. Security – “Assume Breach” in Practice

## What “Assume Breach” Means
Assume breach means:
- Act as if an attacker is already inside your environment.
- Design security to detect quickly and limit damage.

**The problem many organizations face:**
- Security tools are fragmented.
- One tool for email.
- One tool for endpoints.
- One tool for logs.

This makes investigations slow and complex.

---

## Microsoft’s Integrated Security Approach
Microsoft combines tools instead of separating them.

Two important terms:
- **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**
  - Collects and analyzes security logs.
  - Detects suspicious behavior across systems.
- **XDR (Extended Detection and Response)**
  - Correlates signals from multiple sources:
    - Endpoints
    - Email
    - Identities
    - Cloud applications
  - Automatically investigates and responds.

Microsoft combines these into:
**Microsoft Defender XDR**  
*(formerly Microsoft 365 Defender)*

---

### Key Security Capabilities
- **Unified Security Portal**
  - One place to see alerts.
  - One investigation experience.
  - Reduced admin complexity.
- **Threat Analytics**
  - Reports written by Microsoft security experts.
  - Explain active threats and mitigation steps.
- **Secured-core Systems**
  - Security built into:
    - Hardware
    - Firmware
    - Operating system
  - Protection starts before the system boots.
  - Prevents advanced malware attacks.
- **Cross-Platform Protection**
  - Works on:
    - Windows
    - macOS
    - Linux
    - Android
    - iOS
- **Microsoft Sentinel**
  - Cloud-based SIEM.
  - Works across:
    - Microsoft cloud
    - Amazon Web Services
    - Google Cloud Platform
    - Other third-party platforms

👉 **This supports Zero Trust by providing visibility everywhere.**

---

# 3. Compliance – Protection from the Inside Out

Zero Trust is not only about stopping hackers.

It is also about:
- Preventing data leaks
- Detecting insider risk
- Protecting sensitive information

---

## Microsoft Purview
Microsoft Purview is a data governance and compliance platform.

It helps organizations:
- Discover where data exists
- Classify data
- Apply protection rules

---

### Key Compliance Features
- **Protected Document Coauthoring**
  - Multiple users can edit protected files.
  - Security controls remain in place.
- **Insider Risk Management**
  - Detects risky internal behavior.
  - Uses machine learning.
  - Respects privacy by design.
- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**
  - Prevents sensitive data from leaving the organization.
  - Works across:
    - Cloud services
    - Browsers
    - On-premises systems
- **Multicloud Data Protection**
  - Same sensitivity labels apply to:
    - Microsoft cloud
    - Other cloud providers
    - On-premises databases

👉 **This ensures Zero Trust protects data everywhere, not just Microsoft systems.**

---

# 4. Skilling – People Are Part of Zero Trust

Even the best tools fail if people do not know how to use them.

Microsoft addresses the security skills gap by providing structured learning paths and certifications.

---

## Microsoft Security Certifications
- **Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals**
  - Entry-level understanding.
- **Information Protection Administrator Associate**
  - Focuses on compliance and data protection.
- **Security Operations Analyst Associate**
  - Focuses on detection and response.
- **Identity and Access Administrator Associate**
  - Focuses on identity and access management using Microsoft Entra ID.

Microsoft also provides:
- **Microsoft Security Technical Content Library**
- Role-based learning content

---

## Final Bootcamp Summary
- Zero Trust is a strategy, not a product.
- Identity is the foundation.
- Security assumes breaches will happen.
-- Compliance protects data from misuse.



# Big Picture First (Very Important)

Microsoft 365 security is **not one single tool**. It is a **set of tools**, and each one protects a different layer of your organization.

For your question, there are **three main security pillars** you must understand:

- **Microsoft Purview** → protects **data**
- **Microsoft Defender XDR** → protects against **attacks and threats**
- **Microsoft Entra ID** (with Conditional Access and Identity Protection) → protects **identity and access**

Think of it this way:
- **Who is the user?** → Microsoft Entra ID
- **Is something attacking us?** → Microsoft Defender XDR
- **Is sensitive data being handled safely?** → Microsoft Purview

---

# 1. Microsoft Purview
**“Data protection, data governance, and compliance”**

### What Purview is for:
Microsoft Purview is about **protecting information**, not users or devices.

It answers questions like:
- What data do we have?
- Where is sensitive data stored?
- Who can access or share it?
- Is data being leaked intentionally or accidentally?

### What Purview protects:
- Documents
- Emails
- Files
- Databases
- Cloud and on-premises data

---

### Core things Purview does (plain explanation):

#### 1. Data classification
Purview can scan files and emails and identify sensitive information such as:
- Credit card numbers
- Government identification numbers
- Confidential company documents

It then **labels them** (for example: *Public, Confidential, Highly Confidential*).

#### 2. Information protection
Once data is labeled, Purview can:
- Encrypt the file
- Prevent copying
- Prevent sharing outside the company
- Restrict printing or downloading

#### 3. Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
This prevents accidental or intentional data leaks.

**Example:**
- A user tries to email a confidential file to a personal email address
- Purview blocks the action or warns the user

#### 4. Insider Risk Management
Purview looks for risky behavior by internal users, such as:
- Downloading large amounts of data
- Accessing sensitive files outside normal work hours

This is done with **privacy controls**, not spying.

**In simple terms:**
Purview protects the **data itself**, no matter where it goes.

---

# 2. Microsoft Defender XDR
**“Threat detection, attack investigation, and response”**

### What Defender XDR is for:
Microsoft Defender XDR focuses on **security threats and attacks**.

It answers questions like:
- Are we being attacked?
- Is malware present?
- Is a user account compromised?
- How did the attack happen?
- How do we stop it quickly?

### What Defender XDR protects:
- Devices (Windows, macOS, Linux, mobile phones)
- Email systems
- User accounts
- Applications
- Cloud workloads

---

### What “XDR” means (important):
**Extended Detection and Response**

This means:
- It does not look at just one thing (like antivirus)
- It correlates signals across many systems

**Example:**
- Suspicious email
- Same user clicks link
- Device shows malware activity
- Account attempts unusual sign-ins

Defender XDR connects all of these together into **one incident**.

---

### Core capabilities explained simply:
#### 1. Threat detection
It detects:
- Malware
- Phishing attacks
- Ransomware
- Suspicious user behavior

#### 2. Investigation
It automatically:
- Analyzes what happened
- Determines how the attack started
- Identifies affected users and devices

#### 3. Response and remediation
It can:
- Isolate infected devices
- Block malicious files
- Reset compromised user accounts
- Stop the attack from spreading

**In simple terms:**
Defender XDR protects your organization from **active attacks and security incidents**.

---

# 3. Microsoft Entra ID (Identity and Access Security)
**“Who can access what, from where, and under what conditions”**

### What Entra ID is for:
It protects **identity**, which is the most targeted attack surface today.

It answers:
- Is this really the user?
- Is this sign-in risky?
- Should access be allowed, blocked, or restricted?

---

### Core security features:
#### 1. Authentication
Verifies who the user is using:
- Passwords
- Multifactor authentication (password + phone, app, or biometrics)
- Passwordless sign-in

#### 2. Conditional Access
This applies rules to sign-ins.

**Example rules:**
- Require multifactor authentication if user signs in from outside the country
- Block access if device is not compliant
- Allow access only to low-risk applications on unmanaged devices

#### 3. Identity Protection
Detects risky sign-ins such as:
- Impossible travel (two countries in minutes)
- Sign-ins from known malicious locations
- Credential theft attempts

**In simple terms:**
Entra ID decides whether a user is allowed to sign in and what they are allowed to access.

---

# Final Side-by-Side Summary (Very Important)

| Tool                  | Main Purpose                     | Protects                                      |
|----------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Microsoft Purview** | Data protection and compliance  | Files, emails, documents, sensitive data    |

| **Microsoft Entra ID** | Identity and access security         | User sign-ins, authentication, access decisions |

---

## One Simple Scenario (Putting It All Together)
A user tries to download a confidential file from home.

- **Microsoft Entra ID**
  - Verifies identity
  - Checks location and device
  - Requires multifactor authentication

- **Microsoft Purview**
  - Recognizes the file as confidential
  - Prevents external sharing or downloading

- **Microsoft Defender XDR**
  - Monitors for malware or suspicious behavior
  - Responds if the device is compromised

---

## One-Sentence Memory Trick
- **Entra ID** = Who are you and should you get in?
- **Defender XDR** = Are we under attack right now?
- **Purview** = Is our data being used





# Manage Secure User Access in Microsoft 365

## Why this module exists (big picture)

Microsoft 365 is not just email and documents. It stores:

- Company email conversations
- Internal documents and files
- Customer information
- Financial data
- Intellectual property (company secrets, designs, plans)

Because Microsoft 365 is cloud-based, users can sign in from anywhere:

- At home
- At the office
- On personal devices
- On public networks

This convenience is also a security risk.

Microsoft created this module to teach administrators how to control **who can sign in**, **how they sign in**, and **under what conditions access is allowed**.

---

## Core Security Problem Microsoft Is Solving

**Passwords alone are no longer enough**

If someone steals a user’s password (through phishing, malware, or data leaks), they can:

- Read company emails
- Download files
- Send messages pretending to be the user
- Disrupt business operations

Microsoft’s approach is not “trust the password”.

Microsoft’s approach is:

- Verify identity continuously and add multiple layers of protection

This is where **secure user access** comes in.

---

## What “Secure User Access” Means in Microsoft 365

Securing user access means:

- Making sure only the right people can sign in
- Making sure they prove who they are
- Making sure access is blocked when something looks risky

Microsoft provides built-in tools to do this.

---

## Security Methods Covered in This Module (Explained Simply)

Let’s go through each one, conceptually first.

### 1. Changing passwords at specified intervals

This means:

- Users are required to change their password after a set number of days  
  Example: every 90 days

**Why Microsoft includes this**

- If a password is stolen and stays unchanged for years, attackers keep access.
- Regular changes:
  - Limit how long a stolen password is useful
  - Reduce long-term exposure

Microsoft still encourages stronger alternatives, but password rotation is still part of many environments.

---

### 2. Creating complex passwords

A complex password means:

- Long
- Uses uppercase letters
- Uses lowercase letters
- Uses numbers
- Uses symbols

**Why Microsoft enforces this**

- Simple passwords are easy to guess or crack.

Microsoft Entra ID can enforce:

- Minimum password length
- Character requirements
- Blocking common or leaked passwords

This is Microsoft reducing human error.

---

### 3. Resetting their own passwords (Self-service password reset)

This allows users to:

- Reset their password without calling the help desk

They must first verify their identity using:

- Phone number
- Email
- Authentication application

**Why Microsoft promotes this**

- Reduces help desk workload
- Improves productivity
- Keeps identity verification secure

Microsoft controls how identity is verified before allowing the reset.

---

### 4. Signing in with multifactor authentication (explained clearly)

**What multifactor authentication really means**

It means:

- Using more than one proof of identity
- Not just “something you know” (password), but also:
  - Something you have (phone, security key)
  - Something you are (biometrics like fingerprint or face)

**Example sign-in flow:**

- User enters password
- Microsoft asks for an additional verification step
- User confirms via phone or application

Even if the password is stolen, the attacker cannot sign in.

**Why Microsoft strongly pushes this**

Microsoft’s internal data shows:

- Multifactor authentication blocks the vast majority of account compromise attempts

This is one of the most important controls in Microsoft 365.

---

### 5. Implementing conditional access policies

**What conditional access means (very important concept)**

Conditional access means:

- Access is allowed only if certain conditions are met

Examples of conditions:

- User location
- Device type
- Risk level of the sign-in
- Application being accessed

**Example rule:**

- Allow access only if the user is on a trusted device
- Require additional verification if the sign-in comes from another country

**Why Microsoft uses conditional access**

Instead of:

- Always allowing
- Or always blocking

Microsoft evaluates risk in real time.

This is a core Zero Trust principle:

- Never trust automatically, always verify

---

### 6. Implementing passwordless authentication

**What passwordless authentication is**

This means:

- Users sign in without typing a password

They use:

- Phone confirmation
- Security key
- Biometric sign-in

**Why Microsoft wants to eliminate passwords**

Passwords:

- Are reused
- Are phished
- Are guessed

Passwordless methods:

- Cannot be easily stolen
- Are tied to the user and device

Microsoft is actively pushing organizations toward passwordless futures.

---

### 7. Implementing Microsoft Entra Smart Lockout

**What Smart Lockout does**

Smart Lockout:

- Detects repeated failed sign-in attempts
- Blocks attackers without locking out legitimate users

It uses:

- Machine learning
- Known attack patterns

**Why this matters**

Attackers often try:

- Automated password guessing
- Credential stuffing

Smart Lockout protects accounts without disrupting real users.

---

## Identity and Access Tools in Microsoft 365

### Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory)

**What Microsoft Entra ID is**

Microsoft Entra ID is:

- A cloud-based identity and access management service

It stores:

- User identities
- Group memberships
- Authentication methods
- Security policies

It is the central identity system behind Microsoft 365.

**Single identity concept (important)**

Each user has:

- One identity
- One account
- One sign-in

That identity works across:

- Email
- Teams
- SharePoint
- OneDrive
- Other cloud applications

This reduces:

- Multiple accounts
- Multiple passwords

**Identity models supported**

Microsoft supports different setups:

- Cloud-only (everything in the cloud)
- Hybrid (on-premises and cloud together)
- Federated (external identity systems)

This allows companies to move to the cloud at their own pace.

**Authentication methods supported**

Microsoft Entra ID supports:

- Password authentication
- Multifactor authentication
- Certificate-based authentication
- Windows Hello for Business

Microsoft gives organizations flexibility without sacrificing security.

---

### Microsoft 365 Admin Center

**What this tool is**

The Microsoft 365 admin center is:

- The main web portal for administrators

From here, administrators:

- Create users
- Assign licenses
- Manage security settings
- Monitor activity
- Respond to issues

**Why Microsoft designed it this way**

- One central place
- Unified experience
- Integrated with all Microsoft 365 services

This reduces complexity for administrators.

---

### Single Sign-On (explained clearly)

**What single sign-on means**

Single sign-on means:

- Sign in once, access multiple services

User signs in one time and gains access to:

- Email
- Files
- Applications

No repeated logins.

**Why Microsoft uses this**

Benefits:

- Better user experience
- Fewer passwords
- Lower phishing risk

Microsoft Entra ID acts as the identity authority for all connected applications.

---

### PowerShell for Microsoft 365 using Microsoft Graph PowerShell Software Development Kit

**What PowerShell is**

PowerShell is:

- A command-line tool
- A scripting language

It allows administrators to:

- Automate tasks
- Perform bulk actions
- Access advanced settings

**Why Microsoft uses Microsoft Graph with PowerShell**

Microsoft Graph:

- Is the single access point for Microsoft cloud data

Using Graph:

- Standardizes management
- Improves security
- Reduces older, fragmented tools

Microsoft is modernizing administration through Graph.

---

### Microsoft Graph Application Programming Interface

**What Microsoft Graph is**

Microsoft Graph is:

- A web service that exposes Microsoft cloud data and functionality

It allows access to:

- Users
- Groups
- Emails
- Files
- Teams
- Devices

**Why Microsoft created Microsoft Graph**

Before Graph:

- Each service had separate interfaces

With Graph:

- One consistent access layer
- Better integration
- Better security

Microsoft uses Graph internally and encourages developers and administrators to use it.

---

## How Everything Fits Together (Exam-Level Understanding)

- Microsoft Entra ID = identity and access foundation
- Admin center = management interface
- Multifactor authentication = identity verification
- Conditional access = risk-based control
- Passwordless authentication = future direction
- Microsoft Graph = unified access to cloud services

---

## Microsoft’s Strategy (Very Important for MS-102)

Microsoft is moving toward:

- Zero Trust security
- Passwordless authentication
-- Cloud-first identity management
- Centralized control through Entra ID and Graph



# Implement Conditional Access Policies (Microsoft Entra ID)

## 1. What Conditional Access REALLY is (plain English)

Conditional Access is a **rule engine inside Microsoft Entra ID**.

It answers this question every single time someone signs in:

> “Should this user be allowed in right now, and if yes, under what conditions?”

Conditional Access is **not**:

- A password checker
- A firewall
- A denial-of-service protection system

Conditional Access only runs **after the user proves who they are the first time** (username + password).

---

## 2. Why Microsoft built Conditional Access

Administrators have two conflicting goals:

- Let users work anywhere, anytime
- Protect company data from:
  - Stolen passwords
  - Phishing
  - Infected devices
  - Unmanaged personal devices

Conditional Access exists to **balance security and usability**.

---

## 3. Where Conditional Access lives

| Component                     | Role                                      |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Microsoft Entra ID**       | Evaluates sign-ins and enforces Conditional Access |
| **Microsoft 365 services**   | Ask Entra ID “Is this user allowed?”     |
| **Microsoft Intune**         | Provides device compliance information   |
| **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** | Provides device risk information |

👉 **Conditional Access is enforced by Microsoft Entra ID, not Microsoft 365 itself.**

---

## 4. Conditional## 4. Conditional Access logic (VERY IMPORTANT)

Conditional Access policies are **IF – THEN rules**.

IF (conditions are true)
THEN (apply access controls)

**Example:**
IF user signs in from outside the corporate network
THEN require multifactor authentication


---

## 5. When Conditional Access runs during sign-in

**Order of events:**

1. User enters username + password
2. First-factor authentication succeeds
3. Conditional Access evaluates:
   - Who is the user?
   - What app are they accessing?
   - Where are they signing in from?
   - What device are they using?
   - Is there any risk?
4. Conditional Access decides:
   - Allow
   - Allow with requirements
   - Block

🚨 **Conditional Access is NOT the first line of defense.**  
It does **NOT** stop denial-of-service attacks.

---

## 6. Signals Conditional Access uses (inputs)

These are the facts Entra ID checks before deciding.

**Common signals:**

1. **User or group**
   - Specific users
   - Groups
   - Administrators
   - Guest users

2. **Location**
   - IP address
   - Countries or regions
   - Trusted corporate networks
   - Unknown locations

3. **Device**
   - Is the device managed?
   - Is it compliant?
   - Is it domain-joined?
   - Is it risky?

4. **Application**
   - Exchange Online
   - SharePoint
   - Teams
   - Custom applications

5. **Risk signals** (from Microsoft Entra Identity Protection)
   - Impossible travel
   - Anonymous IP usage
   - Malware-linked sign-ins

---

## 7. Decisions Conditional Access can make (outputs)

**Decision 1: Block access**
- Most restrictive
- User is completely denied

**Decision 2: Grant access with conditions**
Possible requirements:
- Require multifactor authentication
- Require compliant device
- Require hybrid-joined device
- Require approved application
- Require password change

---

## 8. Conditional Access + Microsoft Intune (device control)

**What Intune adds:**
- Device compliance
- Device configuration
- Application protection policies

**Example:**
IF user accesses SharePoint
AND device is NOT compliant
THEN block access

This prevents:
- Data leaks
- Access from jailbroken or outdated devices
- Unsafe personal devices

---

## 9. Conditional Access + Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

**How they work together:**

| Tool                        | What it provides        |
|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Defender for Endpoint** | Device threat level    |
| **Intune**                | Compliance status      |
| **Entra ID Conditional Access** | Access decision |

**Example:**
IF Defender says device is high risk
THEN Conditional Access blocks Exchange access



# Enable Microsoft Entra Pass-through Authentication  
*(Microsoft MS-102 – Manage Secure User Access)*

---

## 1. First, let us clearly define the problem Microsoft is solving

Most organizations today use **two environments at the same time**:

### **On-premises environment**
This means the company owns and manages its own servers inside the office or data center.  
User accounts are stored in **Active Directory**, which is a directory service that stores:

- Usernames
- Passwords
- Account status (enabled or disabled)
- Password rules
- Allowed sign-in hours

### **Cloud environment (Microsoft 365)**
This includes services like:

- Outlook
- Microsoft Teams
- OneDrive
- SharePoint

These cloud services rely on **Microsoft Entra ID**, which is Microsoft’s cloud-based identity system.

**The core challenge:**

Users do not want:

- One username and password for on-premises
- Another username and password for cloud services

👉 They want **one identity**.

---

## 2. What is Microsoft Entra Pass-through Authentication?

Microsoft Entra **pass-through authentication** is a sign-in method that allows:

- Users to sign in to Microsoft 365 services
- Using their **on-premises Active Directory username and password**
- **Without storing the password in the cloud**

**Key idea:**
> Password validation happens **on-premises**, not in Microsoft’s cloud.

Microsoft Entra ID does **not** check the password itself.  
It only passes the sign-in request through to your on-premises Active Directory.  

That is why it is called **pass-through authentication**.

## 3. Why does Microsoft offer this feature?

Microsoft understands that not all organizations trust cloud-based password validation.

Some companies have strict security rules such as:

- Immediate enforcement when a user account is disabled
- Immediate enforcement of password changes
- Enforcement of sign-in hours
- Legal or regulatory requirements that passwords must never leave on-premises systems

Previously, Microsoft’s solution for this was **Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)**, which required:

- Multiple servers
- Complex certificates
- Load balancers
- High maintenance effort
- High cost

Many organizations found this too complex.

**Microsoft’s response:**
Pass-through authentication is:

- **Simpler**
- **Cheaper**
- **Easier-to-maintain**
- **Cloud-integrated**

## 4. How pass-through authentication compares to other sign-in methods

| Option                              | Where password is validated | Complexity | Notes |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Password hash synchronization**  | Cloud (Microsoft Entra ID) | Low       | Easier to set up, but some orgs disallow |
| **Active Directory Federation Services** | On-premises | High | Requires multiple servers and certificates |
| **Pass-through authentication**    | On-premises | Low | No password stored in cloud, no federation servers |

👉 Microsoft strongly promotes pass-through authentication for organizations that want **on-premises control without complexity**.

---

## 5. Security benefits of pass-through authentication

### 5.1 Reduced password-related attacks
Because passwords are **not stored in the cloud**, this reduces the risk of:

- Phishing attacks
- Password spraying attacks
- Cloud credential database exposure

Even if an attacker steals an on-premises password, that alone is not enough.

---

### 5.2 Integration with Multifactor Authentication
Multifactor authentication means:

- **Something you know** (password)
- Plus **something you have** (one-time code)
- Or **something you are** (biometric like fingerprint)

With pass-through authentication:

- Password is validated on-premises
- Additional authentication factors are enforced by Microsoft Entra ID

So even if a password is compromised, the attacker still cannot sign in.

---

### 5.3 Conditional Access enforcement
Conditional Access allows rules such as:

- Require MFA if the user signs in from another country
- Block access from unknown devices
- Require compliant devices

Pass-through authentication **fully supports Conditional Access**.

👉 Microsoft allows on-premises password control **without losing modern cloud security features**.

---

## 6. Real-time authentication validation

This is a very important concept.

With pass-through authentication:

- Every sign-in request is checked **in real time** against Active Directory

If a user account is:

- Disabled
- Locked
- Outside allowed sign-in hours access is **immediately denied**.

There is **no delay waiting for synchronization**.

This is one of the strongest reasons organizations choose pass-through authentication.
